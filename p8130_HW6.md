## Problem 1

In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the
effects of several variables on a child’s birthweight. This dataset,
available here, consists of roughly 4000 children and includes the
following variables:

babysex: baby’s sex (male = 1, female = 2) bhead: baby’s head
circumference at birth (centimeters) blength: baby’s length at birth
(centimeteres) bwt: baby’s birth weight (grams) delwt: mother’s weight
at delivery (pounds) fincome: family monthly income (in hundreds,
rounded) frace: father’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 =
Puerto Rican, 8 = Other, 9 = Unknown) gaweeks: gestational age in weeks
malform: presence of malformations that could affect weight (0 = absent,
1 = present) menarche: mother’s age at menarche (years) mheigth:
mother’s height (inches) momage: mother’s age at delivery (years)
mrace: mother’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto Rican,
8 = Other) parity: number of live births prior to this pregnancy
pnumlbw: previous number of low birth weight babies pnumgsa: number of
prior small for gestational age babies ppbmi: mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI
ppwt: mother’s pre-pregnancy weight (pounds) smoken: average number of
cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy wtgain: mother’s weight gain
during pregnancy (pounds)

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data,
etc.).

birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv")%>%janitor::clean_names()

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in
making this plot.

**Answer** By looking at the scatterpoint graph of birthweight vs other
indicators, a selection of indicators was chosen. Besides, family income
was included as there is research suggesting family income is correlated
with
    birthweight

Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use crossv\_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight, 100)

cv_df = 
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(reg_bwt  = map(train, ~lm(bwt~blength+fincome+gaweeks+wtgain+bhead*babysex+mrace+frace,data = .)),
         model_ref1  = map(train, ~lm(bwt~gaweeks+blength ,data = .)),
         model_ref2  = map(train, ~lm(bwt~blength+bhead+babysex+blength*bhead+babysex*blength+bhead*babysex+blength*bhead*babysex,data = .)))%>% 
  mutate(rmse_reg_bwt = map2_dbl(reg_bwt, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_model_ref1 = map2_dbl(model_ref1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_model_ref2 = map2_dbl(model_ref2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))


cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”. **Answer** As it occured, the model
construsted by me outperform the two given model as it have less
cross-validated prediction error

### Problem 2

For this problem, we’ll use the 2017 Central Park weather data that
we’ve seen elsewhere. The code chunk below (adapted from the course
website) will download these data.

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

The boostrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a
parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down
distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We’ll focus on a
simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the
predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities
estimated from these data:

r̂2 log(β̂0∗β̂1)

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your
estimates, and describe these in words.

``` r
boot_straps = 
  weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 5000)

logbeta = function(df){log(df[[1,2]]*df[[2,2]])}
rsquare = function(df){pull(df,"r.squared")}

bs_result = boot_straps%>%
mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ))

bs_result=bs_result %>%mutate(
    result =  map(models, broom::tidy),
    results_logbeta = map_dbl(result, logbeta),
   results_r2 = map(models, broom::glance),
    results_r2 = map_dbl(results_r2,.%>%pull(r.squared)))
    
  

bs_result=bs_result%>%select(-strap,-models,-result)
bs_result%>%pivot_longer(names_to = "para", values_to = "value", cols = results_logbeta:results_r2)%>%
  ggplot()+geom_density(aes(x = value ,color = para) )+facet_grid(~para,scales = "free")
```

Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5%
quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for r̂2 and log(β̂0∗β̂1)

**Answer** The 95% confidence interval for log(β̂0∗β̂1) is as followed

``` r
pull(bs_result,results_logbeta)%>%quantile( probs = c(2.5,97.5)/100)
```

    ##     2.5%    97.5% 
    ## 1.962783 2.059198

The 95% confidence interval for r̂^2 is as followed

``` r
pull(bs_result,results_r2)%>%quantile( probs = c(2.5,97.5)/100)
```

    ##      2.5%     97.5%
